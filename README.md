# Implementation-independent Cucumber features

This is the collection of features that are expected to run successfully against any Cucumber implementation.

The functionalities described within [`basic_feature_execution.feature`](https://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber-features/blob/master/basic_feature_execution.feature) should be sufficient to execute the whole Cucumber feature suite. 

## Step definition specifications

TODO. See Cucumber.js' [step definitions](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/master/features/step_definitions/cucumber_steps.js) for the time being.
